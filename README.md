This is a sample Selenium-Java Framework designed for web automation testing. It includes the following features:

- **Maven Project:** Dependencies managed via pom.xml.

- **Reporting:** Utilizes Extent Report for comprehensive reporting.
- **Page Object Model Design Pattern:** Implemented for efficient and scalable test automation.
- **Log4J:** Integrated for logging purposes.
- **Properties File:** Configuration parameters stored in a properties file (config.properties).

## Configuration
The framework uses a properties file (config.properties) to manage configuration parameters such as URLs, browser options, timeouts, etc. You can modify these properties as per your requirements.
